# Flow changes

## 2026-09-17 - Analytics from competency cards

- The Analytics button at the bottom-left of each Learn & Practice card opens that competency's analytics directly, beside Start practice on the right. The selected card is retained for refresh and return to practice.

## 2026-09-11 - Blueprint specification actions

- Reset Matrix and Create Competency Matrix appear only after Create Questions Split has completed, keeping the initial cognition stage focused on entering LoT/HoT percentages.

## 2026-09-10 - Live practice sharing updates

- Newly shared sessions appear in the selected competency's practice list without reloading, including shares from another tab.
- Updates preserve the active filter, page, existing attempts, and current answers.

## 2026-09-10 - Competency analytics

- View Analytics opens the selected competency's completed-attempt summary, score trend, type breakdown, and history.
- Back returns to the practice list with its previous filter and page.

## 2026-09-10 - Confirm leaving unfinished practice

- Home during an unfinished practice or retake asks whether to continue practice or save and leave for the session list.
- Closing the confirmation keeps the current answers; Home from a completed review returns directly.

## 2026-09-10 - Resume practice retakes

- Returning Home during a retake preserves its draft and keeps the last completed marks, Score, and Review accessible.
- Unfinished retakes show Retake in progress and Resume Retake; reviewing a completed attempt does not overwrite the draft.
- Submitting a retake updates the completed result and restores the Retake action.

## 2026-08-07 — Overall analytics student result navigation

- Student search on Overall Analytics now opens the existing completed student-result view by click or keyboard selection.
- Returning from a result opened through Overall Analytics restores the Overall Analytics page and its active filters instead of returning to the evaluation list.

## 2026-08-12 - LAQ question creation layout

- LAQ creation now opens with a case-stem-first layout, subject/topic selectors in the header, and an initial sub-question row.
- LAQ sub-questions now carry their own competency, thinking level, marks, category, cognitive level, and difficulty controls, with total weightage calculated from sub-question marks.

## 2026-08-18 - Create assessment question authoring flow

- Create Assessment now uses the same MCQ, LAQ, and SAQ authoring flow as Question Bank's Create New Question tab.
- Questions generated from Create Assessment continue into the Preview step so the assessment can be reviewed before approval.

## 2026-08-20 - Learn and practice navigation

- Learn & Practice is now available from the main sidebar immediately after My Assessment.
- Selecting Learn & Practice opens the new practice overview page at `/learn-practice`.

## 2026-09-17 - Attempt history analytics popup

- Each completed attempt has a View analytics action that opens its own saved Bloom's taxonomy coverage in a modal.
- Closing the modal returns focus to that row's View button without leaving competency analytics.

## 2026-09-17 - Practice report search and pagination

- Faculty practice reports support student name/ID search and five-row pagination. Searching and opening another report reset the report page; unavailable Previous/Next actions are disabled.

## 2026-09-17 - In Progress faculty filter

- Added In Progress between Completed and Scheduled. Its count and results include competency groups with at least one In Progress practice, using the existing search and pagination reset behaviour.

## 2026-09-17 - Faculty competency analytics

- View Analytics on a shared competency opens /facultyviewanalytics with the selected competency; Back preserves the faculty list's search, status filter, page and expanded groups.
- The faculty page supports practice selection, cohort participation/score summaries, question coverage charts, and student search/status filtering with pagination.
- Student View opens /facultyviewanalytics/student using only that student's results, and returns to the prior faculty analytics filters.
- Faculty analytics reads identified student submissions from shared practice history and accepts an explicit cohort roster. Missing data no longer falls back to sample students. Learn & Practice acts as the student workflow: new submissions use the current profile identity regardless of its shell role and appear in faculty analytics through shared browser storage. Anonymous legacy attempts remain unassigned. Without a complete roster, assigned and pending totals remain unavailable.


## 2026-09-17 - Faculty analytics default sidebar

- Faculty Analytics opens with the sidebar collapsed to icons, including direct entry and refresh. The top navbar stays visible and its sidebar toggle remains available.
